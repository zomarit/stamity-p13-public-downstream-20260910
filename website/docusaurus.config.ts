/**
 * The documentation site.
 *
 * ONE HOME PER SUBJECT. The pages under `../docs` — the generated reference and the hand-written
 * guides — ARE the documentation. This directory renders them and adds nothing: there is no
 * `website/docs`, no copy step, and no second copy of any page to drift from the first. The docs
 * plugin reads the repository's `docs/` directory directly, so a page edited (or regenerated) in
 * the tree is the page the site serves, and `git diff` is the only place a docs change appears.
 *
 * The site is NOT deployed by merging. `stamity.dev` is claimed and serves this site, and
 * `.github/workflows/docs-site.yml` builds on every pull request and push and stops there;
 * publishing takes an armed run — a `workflow_dispatch` that sets `deploy` to true, or a Release
 * run that succeeded on a real `v*` tag push. So `url` below is the address readers are already
 * served at, not a declaration of intent: the canonical and sitemap metadata it feeds point at a
 * live site, and moving it moves where every published page claims to live.

  // ships only what a build reads — this directory, plus the `assets/logo.svg` the plugin
  // manifests point at. Docusaurus can only serve what is under `static/`, so the copy is
  // structural rather than a choice, and the thing to know is which direction it flows: a mark is
  // re-cut outside and copied here, never edited here. README's banner reads the two wordmarks
  // from this directory too, by repo-relative path. `static/` is served from the site root, so
  // every reference below is `/img/<file>`. That rule governs the product's MARKS and only those:
  // a page-owned decorative glyph — the two Primer octicons `src/pages/index.tsx` inlines — is
  // not one, so it lives as path data in the page that draws it, attributed beside that path, and
  // is never the product's mark wearing another licence.

    // ONE THEME NAME IN BOTH MODES, AND `base` RATHER THAN A PRESET. `base` is the theme whose
    // variables are all overridable: its `calculate()` copies the overrides in, runs its own
    // derivation pass, then copies them in again, so nothing derived can beat an explicit value
    // (mermaid 11.17.2, `src/themes/theme-base.js`, extracted from the bundle's sourcemap). The
    // two modes carry the same name deliberately — the theme spreads `theme` last over a single
    // shared `options` object (`@docusaurus/theme-mermaid/lib/client/index.js:15-21`), so there
    // is no per-mode `themeVariables` slot and a palette that differs by mode is not expressible
    // here at all. What follows is therefore ground-independent by construction.
    //
    // THE TWO LIVE FAILURES IT FIXES. Computed styles read off the built site at 1280 in both
    // schemes, against the grounds `html` actually paints — paper #FBFBFD (`--ifm-background-color`
    // in `src/css/custom.css`) and ink #09090C. `neutral` drew a light-mode node border of
    // #999999 at 2.76:1 on paper, below WCAG 1.4.11's 3:1 for the boundary of a component; `dark`
    // drew a dark-mode edge label of #CCCCCC on a #585858 chip at 4.43:1, below 1.4.3's 4.5:1 for
    // text. Both are failures on the shipped page. Alongside them the node plane was invisible on
    // both grounds — #EEEEEE at 1.12:1 on paper, #1F2020 at 1.22:1 on ink.
    //
    // EVERY PAIR, ON BOTH GROUNDS. #6B24FF is the mark's own violet, unmodified — the value
    // `--ifm-color-primary` carries in light mode: 6.12:1 on paper and 3.15:1 on ink, so the node
    // plane and the edge-label chip clear 3:1 without knowing which ground they landed on.
    // #8A52FF draws every border, line and arrowhead: 4.29:1 on paper, 4.48:1 on ink. White on
    // #6B24FF is 6.32:1 — the same pair `--ifm-button-color` already rides — and it carries every
    // label, node and edge alike, because NO colour reaches 4.5:1 against both #FBFBFD and
    // #09090C: the paper ceiling is relative luminance 0.175768 and the ink floor is 0.187600, an
    // empty band. That is why no text here sits on the page ground and why the edge label is a
    // chip rather than bare text. The border on its own fill is 1.42:1 and is decorative only —
    // 1.4.11's boundary duty is discharged by the fill itself at 3.15:1 and 6.12:1.
    //
    // THE CONSTRAINT THAT COMES WITH THE EMPTY BAND. "Ground-independent by construction" is a
    // claim about text on an OWNED fill, which is every string this palette paints today. Text
    // mermaid draws straight onto the page ground is outside it: white is 1.03:1 on paper, and
    // base's derived #333333 would be 1.57:1 on ink, so neither value — nor any third one —
    // clears 4.5:1 in both modes. Every white below is load-bearing on a chip and stays; what
    // does not follow it is a diagram whose text sits on the ground. A `title:` line, a sequence
    // diagram's messages, a gantt's axis labels: each needs a per-mode palette, which the single
    // shared `options` object above cannot express, so no such diagram is added to this site until
    // that lands — the fix is a per-mode theme, never a compromise colour picked here.
    //
    // NO `classDef` IN THE FENCE. mermaid paints a decision diamond through the same rule as
    // every rectangle — `polygon` shares the selector list with `rect` in its flowchart styles —
    // so no theme variable separates it, and the only lever that would is a `classDef` in
    // `docs/working-with-stamity.md`. That page is at the 150 lines this run budgeted for it, and
    // the diamond is already separated by its shape, so those two lines stay unspent and the
    // diamond renders violet among violet rectangles rather than near-black among near-black.
