// The enterprise upstream lane: take an upstream release into a fork of this repository through
// an isolated update branch, and say what happened in words a reviewer can act on.
//
// A fork changes things — a rule's prose, a default under `src/`, a generated tree — and then
// wants the next upstream release without losing that work. Git alone gives it a merge and a
// list of conflicted paths. This lane adds the three answers the spec asks for
// (`docs/specs/enterprise-upstream-lane.md`): which upstream release is REALLY in the branch, an
// integration attempt that cannot damage the branch it integrates into, and a report that names
// what happened. It is a plain script rather than a CLI verb because it has to run in a tree
// that is mid-merge, where `src/` may not compile and `dist/` may be stale; like
// `scripts/leak-gate.mjs` it uses Node built-ins and the `git` binary and imports nothing from
// `src/`.
//
// Usage: node scripts/upstream.mjs <verb> [options]        (or: npm run upstream -- <verb> ...)
//
//   status      derive the integrated release, the target release, the candidates, the
//               divergence and the affected paths from history; merge nothing.
//   preview     perform the merge in a throwaway detached worktree, report conflicts, the diff
//               stat, the release notes and the affected paths, then abort it and remove the
//               worktree. The operator's tree, index, stash list and branches are byte-identical
//               before and after.
//   integrate   create `stamity-upstream/<tag>` from the target branch head, check it out under
//               `.stamity/upstream-work/<tag>/`, merge the release there, regenerate, run the
//               fork's gates, write the record and commit — or leave the merge in progress and
//               report every conflict.
//   continue    finish an in-progress merge after the human resolved the non-generated
//               conflicts: regenerate, stage the generated paths, refuse any leftover marker,
//               run the gates, write the record, commit.
//   validate    re-run the gates on an existing update branch and commit a fresh record
//               (`upstream lane: gates re-run for <tag>`), so a branch fixed by hand can turn
//               from `validation-failed` to `integrated` without rewriting history.
//   abort       abort the in-progress merge, remove the update worktree, and delete the update
//               branch only when it carries no commit beyond the target head it was cut from.
//   help        print this usage.
//
//   --json             one JSON document on stdout and nothing else there; progress goes to stderr
//   --config <path>    read the configuration from <path> instead of `.stamity/upstream.json`
//   --release <tag>    select a release explicitly (status, preview, integrate; also names the
//                      update branch for continue, validate and abort when several exist)
//   --prerelease       admit tags carrying a prerelease suffix when picking the newest release
//   --offline          skip the fetch and read what the last fetch brought
//   --no-gates         do not run the gates; the record then says `skipped`, which never counts
//                      as integrated
//   --recreate         with integrate: delete a stale update branch that carries nothing but the
//                      lane's own merge commit, and start over
//   --branch <name>    take <name> as the target branch instead of the configured one, for every
//                      verb: `status` against the update branch itself, or `integrate` from a
//                      runner checkout whose branch carries another name
//
// The regenerate commands and the gates are the fork's own, read from the MERGED tree: `integrate`,
// `continue` and `validate` run them through the shell with the caller's environment, so a release
// is reviewed before those verbs run on a workstation holding credentials, or they run in CI, where
// the prepare job holds none. The report says so on the first run of either per invocation.
//
// Invariants, quoted from the spec; every verb below is written against them.
//   1. The target branch is never written. The lane reads the fork's integration branch and
//      writes only an update branch, in its own worktree.
//   2. History is the marker. A release is "integrated" only when its upstream commit is an
//      ancestor of the target branch AND no integration record for it says the gates failed or
//      were skipped. Ancestry with no record at all counts: records are evidence that may be
//      deleted (REQ-UPSTREAM-010), and a fork's history from before the lane carries none.
//   3. No conflict marker is ever committed. `continue` refuses while any unmerged index entry
//      or any `<<<<<<<`/`=======`/`>>>>>>>` marker line remains in a tracked file.
//   4. No blanket side preference. The lane never runs `merge -X ours`, `-X theirs`,
//      `checkout --ours/--theirs` over the conflict set, `reset --hard`, a force push, or a file
//      copy that hides a conflict. Generated paths are regenerated from their sources.
//   5. Both sides' work survives. Every commit reachable from the target branch and from the
//      upstream release stays reachable from the update branch's merge commit.
//   6. Idempotent by construction. Running any verb twice with the same inputs produces the
//      same outcome and no second copy of any artifact.
//   7. Nothing leaves the machine. No network call other than `git fetch` of the configured
//      upstream.
//
// Exit codes follow the CLI's three-status contract (`docs/cli-reference.md`, "Exit statuses"):
//   0  up-to-date, update-available, integrated (and aborted, help)
//   1  validation-failed, conflict, conflict-pending, update-branch-stale, regenerate-failed,
//      ancestry-missing, ancestry-lost — a result the caller must act on, with a full report
//   2  not-a-fork (no `.stamity/upstream.json`), a usage or configuration error, git missing or
//      older than 2.24 (the floor is `--end-of-options`, which guards every revision a record
//      supplies), a remote of the configured name with a different URL, a failed fetch
//
// THE JSON DOCUMENT (`--json`). One object, the same shape for every verb and every outcome, so a
// consumer — the opt-in GitHub workflow is the first — branches on `outcome` and reads the rest:
//   tool "stamity-upstream-lane", version 1, verb, outcome, exitCode,
//   config        the resolved configuration with defaults applied, plus `path` it was read from
//   upstream      { url, remote, branch, defaultBranchHead }
//   integrated    { tag, commit, record } — the highest release in the target's ancestry whose
//                 record agrees (absent counts as agreeing: the record is evidence, never
//                 authority) — or null
//   integratedReleases  every release in the target's ancestry, oldest first, each with its
//                 record and `verified` (record absent, passed or none)
//   unverified    ancestry present, record says failed or skipped — never counted as integrated
//   target        { tag, commit, date, isPrerelease } — the selected release — or null
//   candidates    [{ tag, commit, date }] every release newer than the integrated one, in order
//   skipped       the candidate tags the target's single merge covers besides the target itself
//   divergence    { behindRelease, aheadOfRelease, upstreamAheadOfRelease }
//   affected      { overlaps, watched, shadowed, renamed } — the drift rows of REQ-UPSTREAM-008;
//                 the shadowed rows are derived from the consumer override tree and from the
//                 bundled fork layer `fork/` (REQ-FORK-008), plus the configured `shadows`
//   conflicts     [{ path, kind, generated, deletedBy?, renamedFrom?, renamedTo?, resolvedBy?,
//                 regenerated? }] kind is one of content, modify/delete, rename/delete, add/add,
//                 other; `regenerated: false` marks a generated path that regeneration left
//                 untouched, which stays unmerged for the human
//   gates         [{ name, run, status, exitCode, durationMs, outputTail }] status is one of
//                 passed, failed, skipped
//   regenerate    [{ run, status, exitCode, durationMs, outputTail }]
//   unlistedGenerated  [{ path, change }] tracked paths the regenerate commands rewrote that no
//                 `generatedPaths` glob covers — outcome `regenerate-failed`, nothing committed
//   branch        the update branch name or null;  worktree  its absolute path or null
//   mergeCommit   the merge commit's sha or null;  record  the record's repository path or null
//   lostRecords   [{ path, tag, commit }] the records whose release the history lacks — the
//                 diagnosis `status` reports as `ancestry-lost`; `preview` and `integrate` carry
//                 the rows and proceed for the selected release
//   releaseNotes  the `## [<version>]` section of upstream's CHANGELOG.md at the release, or null
//   diffStat      the merged diff stat (preview), or null
//   report        the markdown report, as one string;  messages  human guidance, one per line
// Outside `--json`, the markdown report is what stdout carries.
//
// Two additions to the spec's outcome vocabulary, both for verbs the spec leaves unnamed:
// `aborted` (abort, exit 0 — also when there was nothing to abort, so a second run is a no-op)
// and `help`. `status` reports `validation-failed` when the selected release is an ancestor of
// the target but its record says the gates failed or were skipped: the release is in history and
// still not integrated (invariant 2), and neither `up-to-date` nor `update-available` is true.
//
// Design decisions the spec leaves to the implementation, so nobody re-derives them:
//   - The target branch head is read from the local branch named in the configuration, then
//     from `refs/remotes/origin/<branch>`; when neither exists the run exits 2 naming both.
//   - `rerere` is enabled per command (`-c rerere.enabled=true` on the merge and on the merge
//     commit), never persisted: a linked worktree shares the repository configuration, and a
//     `git config` write there would have changed the operator's repository for good. The
//     recorded preimages and resolutions still land in the shared `rr-cache` of the repository,
//     which is the point — the next merge of the same conflict replays them.
//   - Gates and regenerate commands run through the platform shell with the update worktree as
//     cwd, output captured, the last lines kept in the report. `--no-gates` records `skipped`.
//   - Regeneration is measured, not trusted. Every conflicted generated path's content is
//     fingerprinted at merge time (kept in the lane state) and a path is staged only once its
//     content differs from that fingerprint — regeneration produced it, this run or an earlier
//     one; a path regeneration left as git left it stays unmerged for the human, since staging
//     it would have preferred a side (a binary conflict carries "ours" in the worktree). Tracked
//     paths outside `generatedPaths` are fingerprinted before and after regeneration, and one
//     regeneration rewrote fails the run: the gates would test what the commit lacks.
//   - The upstream URL is echoed without its userinfo (`user:password@`) in every document,
//     message and log line; git itself receives the URL as configured.
//   - `validate` commits a new record on every run: a validation is an event, and the record
//     commit is its evidence, so a second run is a second record rather than a no-op.
//   - Git runs through `execFile`-style spawning with no shell, real paths are composed with
//     `node:path`, and gitignore-style globs (`*`, `**`, `?`, a leading `/` anchor, a `/`
//     directory suffix) are compiled to regular expressions here rather than through a
//     platform matcher, so the same list means the same thing on every host.
//   - A marker scan covers the files the merge touched (`git diff --name-only HEAD` in the
//     update worktree plus every path git reported conflicted). A bare `=======` line counts
//     only beside a `<<<<<<<`, `>>>>>>>` or `|||||||` line in the same file: alone it is a
//     Markdown setext underline, and refusing forever on one would block a fork with no way out.
//   - A merge whose only conflicts are generated paths needs no human: `integrate` finishes it
//     the way `continue` would, since "every non-generated conflict is resolved" already holds.
//   - Commits use the repository's identity; when git cannot determine one (a CI runner with no
//     `user.*`), a placeholder identity on the reserved `.invalid` domain is used and the report
//     says so. The merge itself takes the same fallback: `git merge` resolves the committer
//     identity before it touches a file, `--no-commit` notwithstanding, so a runner with no
//     identity failed at the merge and never reached the commit that carried the fallback — the
//     first dispatch on GitHub Actions found it. Hooks are bypassed (`--no-verify`): the fork's
//     gates are its declared ones.
//   - Lane state for an in-progress merge (the release, the head the branch was cut from, the
//     conflicts with their kinds) lives in the update worktree's own git directory, so
//     `continue` can name what the human resolved without re-deriving it.
