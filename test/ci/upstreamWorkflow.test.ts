/**
 * Drift guard on `.github/workflows/upstream-update.yml` — the opt-in lane that carries an
 * upstream release into a fork.
 *
 * The gates EVERY workflow in the directory meets — SHA-pinned actions with a full three-part
 * version comment, explicit least privilege at workflow and job scope, no npm credential, no
 * `npm publish`, no internal work-item identifiers — are asserted once over the discovered set in
 * test/ci/workflow.test.ts, and this file does not repeat them. What lives here is what is true
 * of THIS file and would be true of nothing else:
 *
 *   the trust split      `prepare` runs the fork's own code — its merge, its regeneration, its
 *                        gates — with `contents: read`, `persist-credentials: false` and no
 *                        secret in the job at all. `publish` holds the three write grants and
 *                        runs only git and `gh`. A future edit that hands `prepare` a token, or
 *                        that lets `publish` execute the fork's code, is the one change that
 *                        turns this lane into a supply-chain path, and it is checked as a
 *                        PROPERTY of the parsed job rather than as a substring of the file.
 *
 *   the opt-in           The canonical repository carries no `.stamity/upstream.json`, so the
 *                        probe must end GREEN here with a notice that sends a reader to
 *                        `docs/enterprise-forks.md`. A workflow that failed in its own
 *                        repository would be a workflow nobody keeps.
 *
 *   never force          `stamity-upstream/<tag>` can carry a human's conflict resolution. The
 *                        absence of a force flag on every `git push` in the file is the whole
 *                        guarantee that the lane cannot delete it.
 *
 *   the publish gate     Evaluated, not read for substrings: a scheduled run publishes (inputs
 *                        are empty on a schedule), a dispatch that ticked `dry_run` does not, and
 *                        the `format()` spelling holds even if the input's declared type changes
 *                        under it. `expect(condition).toContain(...)` would pass on a condition
 *                        that had lost the property.
 *
 *   the workflow refusal A branch's own workflow files run on `push`, under the identity that
 *                        pushed them, so this lane never pushes a range that touches
 *                        `.github/workflows/` — UNCONDITIONALLY, whatever credential the run
 *                        holds. The platform's own refusal for the repository token is a second
 *                        reason, not the reason. Pinned here so an edit that "simplifies" the
 *                        push step cannot make the refusal depend on a secret again.
 *
 *   the trusted re-check `publish` acts on control data — tag, update branch, outcome, merge
 *                        commit — emitted by the job that RAN THE FORK'S CODE. It validates the
 *                        shape of each field before any of it reaches `git`, `gh` or an issue
 *                        body, and fails naming the field.
 *
 *   marker identity      Both issue paths find their issue by an HTML-comment marker the lane
 *                        writes into every body it creates, not by a title a reviewer can edit
 *                        and a fuzzy search can near-miss.
