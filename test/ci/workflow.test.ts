/**
 * Drift guard on every workflow in `.github/workflows/` and the update policy that feeds them.
 *
 * `.github/` is where the properties that make this repository trustworthy are written down, and
 * it is the one place where a "harmless" edit makes CI GREENER rather than redder. Dropping a
 * self-consistency gate, widening a publish condition, un-pinning an action, or handing a job the
 * OIDC token it should not have all pass every other check in the tree. So the workflows are read
 * here as DATA — parsed the way GitHub parses them, from YAML bytes — and the properties that make
 * them gates are pinned:
 *
 *   ci.yml        the three-leg matrix and the per-leg step split, step order (Build before Test,
 *                 so dist/ exists for everything after it), the generate-and-diff triple, the
 *                 aggregator's needs and its result assertion, the concurrency grouping, and the
 *                 lane map that promises to name every lane this repository does not run.
 *   docs-site.yml the build/deploy split: the build job holds nothing elevated, the deploy job
 *                 holds `pages: write` and the OIDC token behind a condition that no push, no
 *                 pull request and no unarmed dispatch can satisfy. That condition is EVALUATED
 *                 against every trigger shape, not string-matched, for the reason release.yml's
 *                 is (see ./workflowExpression.ts).
 *   nightly.yml   the demoted legs, and that nothing here is merge-blocking.
 *   pr-checks.yml the three pull-request-only gates — DCO, title shape, dual size budget — and
 *                 the aggregator that gives them one name a branch rule can bind.
 *   release.yml   the two-job split: the gates job holds no id-token, the publish job holds it
 *                 behind an environment, the publish condition denies everything but a tag push
 *                 and an explicit real-run dispatch, and the release proofs run on BOTH of those.
 *                 The conditions are evaluated rather than string-matched (see
 *                 ./workflowExpression.ts), and the proof script is EXECUTED against a scratch
 *                 repository rather than read for substrings.
 *   every file    every `uses:` pinned to a 40-hex SHA and commented with the precise version;
 *                 every job carrying an explicit least-privilege `permissions` and a timeout; no
 *                 `npm publish` outside the one job whose condition denies a dry run; no npm
 *                 credential at step, job or workflow scope; no internal process vocabulary.
 *
 * THE FILE SET IS READ FROM THE DIRECTORY, not from a list written here. The shared properties in
 * the last group used to run over three hard-coded names while their own wording claimed the whole
 * repository, so a fourth workflow file carrying `id-token: write` and a `run: npm publish` passed
 * every assertion in this suite. Listing the directory is what makes "every workflow" true, and it
 * is what puts a new file under the shared gates on the commit that adds it.
 *
 * The two suites at the bottom go one step further and exercise the probe the `supply-chain` lane
 * runs, because the property that matters there (a failed lookup never reports CLEAN) is not
 * visible in the workflow file at all: it lives in what the script does when the network says no.
